        <h1>Housekeeping report</h1>

        <p>
            This summer was spent arduously cleaning up after well-off families who care way too much about what state
            the house is in when they arrive (even the specks of dust on the staircase skirting board...why?), and not enough
            about how they leave it in for me to clean within 7 hours for the next guests.
        </p>

        <p>
            To gain some appreciation for what I have to deal with, I've compiled a way for me to record all the 'perks' of the job.
        </p>
